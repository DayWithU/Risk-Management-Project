# Project Charter — Risk Management for Small E‑commerce Service

Objective
Design and implement a practical risk-management framework for a small e-commerce service (payments + inventory) to demonstrate risk identification, prioritization, mitigation planning, and reporting.

Scope
- Simulate an online store environment (payment processing, inventory sync, shipping).
- Deliverables: risk register, RAID log, RACI for key tasks, intake form (Google Form), heatmap/dashboard, one-page executive summary, and a 5–7 minute walkthrough video.

Success metrics
- A prioritized risk register with 10–25 realistic risks by Day 14
- Automated intake (Google Form → Sheet) and score calculation by Day 15
- Executive one-pager and dashboard ready by Day 24
