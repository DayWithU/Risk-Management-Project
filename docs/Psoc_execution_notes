# PoC Execution Notes — What to capture during the Payment Failover PoC

Purpose
This guide lists the exact items to capture during PoC execution so results are clear, reproducible and easy to present.

Before the PoC (preparation)
- Confirm test window and notify participants.
- Ensure staging credentials for Gateway A and Gateway B are valid.
- Prepare test cards and note card numbers (test-provider numbers).
- Open the monitoring dashboard and record baseline metrics (payment success rate, latency, error rate). Screenshot baseline.
- Open a shared results sheet/file (templates/poc_results.csv) to record test rows in real time.

During the PoC (record step-by-step)
- Record timestamps for each major event (T0 = start, T1 = failover trigger, T2 = end, rollback time if performed).
- For each test phase (Pre-failover, During-failover, Post-failover, Rollback) record:
  - Number of transactions attempted
  - Number of successful transactions
  - Success rate (%) = success / attempted
  - Error examples (copy full error text or screenshot)
  - Representative transaction IDs (anonymize if needed)
  - Observations (latency, 5xx errors, unexpected behavior)
- Take screenshots of monitoring charts showing payment success/failure before, during and after.
- If rollback happens, record reason and timing, and any side-effects seen.

After the PoC (closeout)
- Fill all
